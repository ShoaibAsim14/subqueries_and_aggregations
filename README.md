 🎓 Student Management System – SQL Subquery & Aggregation Analysis
🧾 Project Description
This project showcases advanced SQL techniques to analyze student performance data across Math, Science, and English. It leverages subqueries, aggregations, and conditional logic to extract key insights, such as identifying top performers, comparing scores to dynamic averages, and bucketing score ranges using CASE expressions.

🔍 Analysis Highlights
- 🛠️ **Database Design**: Students table with a generated `total_score` column
- 🔢 **Subqueries**: Used for conditional filtering against subject-wise averages
- 📊 **Aggregations**: Calculated conditional averages and grouped score ranges
- 🧠 **Window Functions**: Applied for ranking top scorers efficiently
 📈 Key Insights
- Top scorer: **Jessica Miller** with a total score of 278.5
- Most students (58%) scored between **251–275**
- Balanced performers: **Jennifer Anderson**, **Olivia Harris**

  How to Run
1. Open the SQL file in **MySQL Workbench**
2. Execute queries step by step to replicate the analysis
3. Review results directly in query output or export as CSV if needed

 📌 Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench (for SQL query design and execution)
- GitHub (for version control and documentation)
